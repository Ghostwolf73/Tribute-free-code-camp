            <p><b>Here is how Shin became a general</b></p>
            <ul>

                <li>Shin is left alone and works hard to catch up to Hyou</li>
                <li>hyou shows back up hounded at death's door and tells Shin to go to the mountains</li>
                <li>Shin meets a boy who likes almost exactly like Hyou and he turns out to be the king</li>
                <li>Shin works with the king and help save his life</li>
                <li>Shin becomes a soldier and on his first battle becomes a 100 man unit commander</li>
                <li>Shin meets a great general called Ou Ki</li>
                <li>Shin trains under Ou Ki</li>
                <li>Shin inherites Ou Ki's glaive and becomes a 1000 man commander</li>
                <li>Shin fights in different battles and becomes a 5000 men commander</li>
                <li>Shin becomes a great general</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>I will become a great general under the heavens <br> -- Shin of the Hi Shin unit</i></p>
